      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Growing up, I was all over the place when it came to figuring out what I wanted to do for a career. In high school, I seriously thought about becoming a doctor. I mean, who doesn't think about the doctor dream at some point, right? But honestly, I didn't have a clue about the different types of doctors or what their jobs really involvedâ€”pros, cons, daily life, you name it.</p>
      <p>At the same time, I was also pretty taken with the idea of becoming a Petroleum Engineer. The thought of moving to the Gulf States and being in the heart of the oil world seemed super cool. But again, I was stuck. I had no idea how to get there or what I needed to do to make that happen.</p>
      <p>Then, somewhat by fluke, I ended up in computer science. I picked it without much thought, just following a gut feeling rather than actual knowledge. Lucky for me, I made the right choice.</p>
